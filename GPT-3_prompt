    **Do you know Decision Model and Notation and can you create a DRD? \\
     Given a text description you are expected to provide a DRD in graphviz code. Examples:  \\
     Input: With the recent adoption of stricter environmental laws, the approval of infrastructure projects needs to take into account the amount of additional nitrogen pollution each project would cause in the environment. The maximum allowed pollution has been set at a maximum of 14 grams per hectare per year. Any project which would cause this bar to be exceeded can not be approved. Additionally, any infrastructure project also needs to be approved by an architect before a final approval can be given.
     
    Output: digraph  { "Approval of infrastructure project" [shape=box] "Architects Approval"   "Compliance with pollution" [shape=box]  "Additional Expected pollution of project" "Approval of infrastructure project" $\rightarrow$ "Architects Approval" [dir=back] "Approval of infrastructure project" $\rightarrow$ "Compliance with pollution" [dir=back] "Compliance with pollution" $\rightarrow$ "Additional Expected pollution of project" [dir=back]} \\

    Input: The health risk level of a patient should be assessed from the obesity level, waist circumference and the sex of the patient. Furthermore, the degree of obesity should be determined from the BMI value and sex of the patient. Patient’s height and weight are considered to calculate his BMI value. If the weight of the patient given in kgs and height of patient given in meters, then the BMI value is weight/(height*height).
    
    Output: digraph  { "Health Risk Level" [shape=box]  "Obesity Level" [shape=box]   "BMI Value" [shape=box]  "Height"  "Weight"  "Sex"  "Waist Circumference"	"Health Risk Level" $\rightarrow$ "Obesity Level" [dir=back] "Health Risk Level" $\rightarrow$ "Waist Circumference" [dir=back] "Health Risk Level" $\rightarrow$ "Sex" [dir=back] "Obesity Level" $\rightarrow$ "BMI Value" [dir=back] "Obesity Level" $\rightarrow$ "Sex" [dir=back] "BMI Value" $\rightarrow$ "Height" [dir=back] "BMI Value" $\rightarrow$ "Weight" [dir=back] } \\

  
    Input: In order to expand the immunity of the population and protect the most vulnerable people against the Covid-19 virus, the vaccination must take place over different periods. The period in which a person will get vaccinated depends on the number of available doses and the person’s assigned group. The person’s assigned group is divided into three groups depending on their vulnerability, exposure, medical risks and age. If you are a resident or employee in a residential care center or if you work in a first line care occupation then you belong to the most vulnerable and exposed people and you will be vaccinated first. Moving on to the second group, if you are older than 65, or if you are between 45 and 65 with an increased medical risk due to healthcare issues, you will get vaccinated next. Lastly, the third group consists of the broader population of people above the age of 18. Invitations will be sent via text message, letter or email. After receiving a personal vaccine invitation, you need to register in order to confirm or move the appointment.
    
    Output: digraph  { "Vaccination period" [shape=box]  "Number of available doses" "Persons assigned group" [shape=box]  "Exposure"  "Medical Risk"   "Vulnerability"  "Age" 	"Vaccination period" $\rightarrow$ "Number of available doses" [dir=back] "Vaccination period" $\rightarrow$ "Persons assigned group" [dir=back] "Persons assigned group" $\rightarrow$ "Exposure" [dir=back] "Persons assigned group" $\rightarrow$ "Medical Risk" [dir=back] "Persons assigned group" $\rightarrow$ "Vulnerability" [dir=back]"Persons assigned group" $\rightarrow$ "Age" [dir=back]} \\                                                                  
    Input: Eligibility for smallpox vaccine is dependent on risk and outbreak. If you are at risk or there is an outbreak then you are eligible for a smallpox vaccine. Risk is determined from the contact with a similar virus, labworker or smallpox virus exposure. You are at risk if you are in contact with a similar virus and you are a labworker. You are also at risk if there is smallpox virus exposure.
                       
    '-Output: digraph  {  "Eligibility for smallpox vaccine" [shape=box]   "Outbreak"    "Risk" [shape=box]    "Contact with similar virus"   "Labworker" "smallpox virus exposure" "Eligibility for smallpox vaccine" $\rightarrow$ "Outbreak" [dir=back] "Eligibility for smallpox vaccine" $\rightarrow$ "Risk" [dir=back] "Risk" $\rightarrow$ "Contact with similar virus" [dir=back] "Risk" $\rightarrow$ "Labworker" [dir=back] "Risk" $\rightarrow$ "smallpox virus exposure" [dir=back]} \\
    
    Only provide the expected Decision Requirements Diagram in formatted graphviz code with inputs as ovals and decision as rectangles and arrows going bottom-up from inputs to decisions as shown in the examples. Do not write anything else. Analyze the following text: \textbf{Insert text}.**
